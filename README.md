## Project Information

#### Topic

- Tetris 

#### Description

Tetris is a traditional and common game, where blocks in different shapes drop from the top of the screen, and the players should try to tessellate the dropped blocks. The player gets a credit whenever a row is filled with blocks.

#### Rules

1. The falling blocks are randomly determined.
2. If the stacked blocks exceeds the height limit in the game board, the game is over.

#### Implementation

1. Random Events
	- The falling blocks are randomly determined.
2. Arrays
	-  The shape of the blocks are stored and manipulated in arrays.
3. Dynamic Memory management
	- The gameboard is implemenented using dynamic memory.
4. File Management
	- File management will be implemented to storing the game records (such as the scores).
5. Modularity
	- The code will be split into multiple files for better modularity and manageability.
